Customers are the cornerstone of every industry, and in banking, they are at the heart of customer-dependent organizations. Long-term customers are directly tied to revenue generation, making it essential for banks to retain them. According to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer churn by just 5% can result in a 25% to 85% increase in profits. Given the significant impact customers have on bank profitability, they are the most critical asset in modern banking, alongside other key pillars such as capital, liquidity, risk, and asset management. By focusing effectively on these five essential pillars, bank executives can maximize profitability.
