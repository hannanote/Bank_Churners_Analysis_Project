## Bank Churners Machine Learning Analysis
#### This project applies machine learning model to predict if a bank customer will stay or leave the credit card service. 

### Purpose
Customers are the cornerstone of every industry, and in banking, they are at the heart of customer-dependent organizations. Long-term customers are directly tied to revenue generation, making it essential for banks to retain them. According to the Harvard Business Review, reducing customer churn by just 5% can result in a 25% to 85% increase in profits. Given the significant impact customers have on bank profitability, they are the most critical asset in modern banking, alongside other key pillars such as capital, liquidity, risk, and asset management. By focusing effectively on these five essential pillars, bank executives can maximize profitability.

Customer churn, the process of losing customers to competitors, poses a fundamental challenge to banks, leading to revenue loss. Managing churn requires identifying customers who are likely to switch to other banks. As Risselada et al. (2010) demonstrated, effective churn management is crucial for building long-term relationships that maximize the value of the customer base.

Predicting customer churn using big data has become a focal point in machine learning research. Various models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, and deep neural networks, have been employed to classify customers as churners or non-churners. The reasons for predicting churn are clear:

1. Profitability Improvement:   
   Retaining customers ensures continued revenue generation.

2. Customer Relationship Maintenance:   
   Preventing churn helps sustain long-term relationships, fostering loyalty and opening opportunities to offer additional financial products and services.

3. Data and Insight Accumulation:   
   Retaining high-risk customers allows for the accumulation of valuable data, providing critical insights for future risk management and the development of personalized services.
This report will explore the application of machine learning techniques in predicting customer churn, highlighting its importance in modern banking.
